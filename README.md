This project focuses on leveraging SQL for customer segmentation using the Online Retail dataset. Through Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, we aim to understand and categorize customers based on their transactional behavior.
# Customer Segmentation of Online Retail Dataset Using SQL

## Introduction:
The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a valuable technique in marketing and customer relationship management, enabling businesses to segment their customers based on their transactional behavior. This analysis aims to identify high-value customers, understand their purchasing patterns, and tailor marketing strategies to better meet their needs.

## Insights:
- **RFM Metrics Calculation:** The first step involves calculating the RFM metrics for each customer. Recency indicates how recently a customer made a purchase, Frequency denotes how often they purchase, and Monetary represents the total amount they spent.
  
- **RFM Scores Assignment:** After calculating the metrics, RFM scores are assigned to each customer based on their behavior. Customers with higher recency, frequency, and monetary values receive higher scores, indicating their higher value to the business.
  
- **RFM Segmentation:** Customers are then segmented based on their RFM scores. In this analysis, they are categorized into three segments: High Value, Mid Value, and Low Value. This segmentation allows businesses to prioritize high-value customers for targeted marketing efforts and personalized experiences.
  
- **Insights from Segments:** Analyzing the RFM segments provides valuable insights into customer behavior. For example, high-value customers may exhibit higher average recency, frequency, and monetary values compared to mid-value and low-value customers.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, RFM analysis offers a structured approach to understanding and segmenting customers based on their transactional behavior. By leveraging RFM insights, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and maximize profitability. Regular monitoring and refinement of RFM segments enable businesses to adapt to changing customer preferences and market dynamics, ensuring long-term success in customer relationship management and revenue generation.
